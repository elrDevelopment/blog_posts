# [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - UI Refactored

If you keep up with UI/UX you may have noticed quite a bit of turbulence coming from the twitter accounts of [@adamwathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) and [@steveschroger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger). Most recently they release I highly successful book and video package called Refactoring UI. Previously, they release a CSS utility-first framework called TailwindCSS. Firstly, go and buy refactoring UI if you are developer that struggles at all with UI layout or design, it is written for you. Secondly, anything that Adam and Steve put out is top notch.

As I write this they have currently just released a course on tailwindcss. A prequile to what I expect would either be a book or full blown course of instruction blending refactoring UI tips in with tailwind, or just putting out a paid version of tailwind that provids a copy and paste component/layout tooling (my hope).

What is so great about tailwind? First, it is 100% extendable. It was made with extendibility and customization in mind. If you are using it and need to customize a look or feel to some of the tooling you can totally override and change what you need to.

## 1. It is just there

I find that when I am programming with tailwind I gain a certain level of confidence over the design process. I felt the same way with bootstrap at first. However, over time I thought my apps looked like 4 million other peoples apps. While you can customize bootstrap; it proved difficult to me. This isn't the case with tailwind. The customizations are well documented and, to me, seemed pleasing. 

Add to that the fact that most of UI moving to a component (reactjs, angular, even MVC) based structure, lets face it we are just making a series of widgets and long-form HTML is just about out the window, so when I am programming the UI, I am focused on a particular component and scope. Tailwind is perfect for this. It is all inline class, post-css markup in the HTML document.

## 2. Intellisense, npm and more

Building applications with Tailwindcss in VS CODE is simple with a [plugin by Brad Cornes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
